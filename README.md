# Feature Extraction and Matching for Similar Images Using Harris Algorithm

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting and matching similar images using the Harris corner detection algorithm. The process involves using machine learning techniques to identify key features in images, applying image transformations to simplify them, and then detecting and matching similar features across different images.

## Key Features
- Utilizes the Harris corner detection algorithm for feature extraction.
- Machine learning techniques for identifying significant image features.
- Image transformation and simplification for efficient processing.
- Feature matching to identify similarities between different images.

## Technical Implementation
- Implements feature extraction and matching algorithms in Python.
- Employs libraries like OpenCV for image processing tasks.
